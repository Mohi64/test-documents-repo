        <h3>Beauty of bangladesh</h3>
        <p>Bangladesh is a land of natural beauty. Across the country, hundreds of rivers flow like spider webs. Therefore, its soil is very fertile. The beauty of the green shaded villages and the fields full of grain captivates the eyes of the visitors. The country of six seasons changes color from time to time. Here we have shared essays and paragraphs on the natural beauty of Bangladesh, which will help the students in their own writing on this topic.

        <p>In summer, though we feel uncomfortable with extreme heat, we get various kinds of sweet fruits in this season. After a long spell of hot weather, the rainy season comes with showers to cool the earth. During the rainy season, the sky often remains overcast with thick black clouds that hover across the sky close to the earthâ€™s surface. The low-lying lands go under water and look like a vast sheet of water. In autumn there is a play of hide and seek among the clouds. The sky on an autumn night is studded with innumerable stars and appears to be a dreamland to the on-lookers. In late autumn Nature smiles with the dew drops in the morning. In winter fields full of winter crops and golden paddy ready for reaping present a panoramic view. After winter comes spring with all its beautiful sights and sounds and makes Bangladesh the queen of all beauties.</p>
